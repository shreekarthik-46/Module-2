# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **76** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `76` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
x=76
print(bin(x))
```

## Output
![bin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d187569-4e5c-458b-80aa-df5602672a34)


## Result
Thus a Python program to convert the number **76** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions is created
